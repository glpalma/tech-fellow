In this repo are the exercises I had to solve in their programming test to be a Tech Fellow associate.

The first exercise asked me to return the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 that were smaller than N. The code can be found in the [teste_facil.py](teste_facil.py) file.

The second exercise was the hardest one for me, even though it was not labeled the hardest on the test. I had to calculate the shortest paths from a select node to all the other nodes in the graph. To solve that, I applied the Dijkstra algorithm on a adjacency-matrix-represented graph. The code is in [teste_intermediario.py](teste_intermediario.py).

The last one, however, was not as hard as the second. It asked me to read a set of names and three types of points for each name from input, with the expected answer being the names sorted by total score. The code is in [teste_dificil.py](teste_dificil.py).

The codes were written in Portuguese-BR because the description of the code were also in that language.
